/*
We did lots of console logging to debug.

Errors mostly happened with individual counter for trick. Initially thought of a counter IN state... did not make sense.
 - Fix was to include counter prop in createTrick and increase/decrease by one.
 - To do so, we found index of trick THEN we accessed the COUNTER prop and added/minus one.

Errors also happened while finding the INDEX number of the tricks. Method 'findIndex'
 - The reason that we were getting errors is because of HOW the variable was passed IN Trick.js
 - I solved the issue by correctly using the prop.
*/

/* 
Steps to completion.
 1. started with components
    - with Trick.js --> Tricks.js --> contexts --> Body.js --> Header.js --> App.js

 2. Looked at Part 4 folder to see what features of React I will use
    - memo, Aux, lifecycle methods.. CC/FC, context, keys/id, multiple input fields, array methods.. map, findIndex, 
    - Good practices like: lean Render code in App.js, split components, optimization of components, context for info

 3. When facing problems, used console.log() to see issues as well as working with the errors on screen.

 4. Simplify things, don't make it harder than it already is... do this more often.
